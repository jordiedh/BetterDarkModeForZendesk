# Better Dark Mode for Zendesk

## Project Overview

Zendesk recently introduced a new dark mode, it looks great but there are a few flaws, the extension allows it to blend in properly.

## Features

- The left side navigation bar remains the same light gray and sticks out like a sore thumb, so my extension changes the colour to blend in more.
- The apps section keeps its white background as majority of these do not yet support dark mode, my extension will change the background colour and make the text whiter for easier visibility.
- Replaces text colour with white and background colours with transparent if an email is sent with weird styling.
- Fixes app buttons not blending properly
